Some of them (like the one below) is pre-programmed, and you can change its parameters. Others will allow you to change their parameters to illustrate learning concepts.\n You can click on the graph to pause the animation.

The ventilator monitor will usually display three waveforms, pressure, flow, and volume.\nThe mode of ventilation describes the relationship between breath types, and cycle variables. The ventilator can either control the volume of air delivered or the pressure applied to the airway.\nFor each one of these modes, try to answer the following questions: What type of breath is delivered to the patient? which waveform changes based on the venilator settings? and which waveform is fixed?\n\r"
