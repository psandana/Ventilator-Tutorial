Some of them (like the one below) is pre-programmed, and you can change its parameters. Others will allow you to change their parameters to illustrate learning concepts.\n You can click on the graph to pause the animation.

	"content": " Modes of Mechanical Ventilation This section describes several modes that are commonly used in today\u0026rsquo;s clinical practice. The ventilator monitor will usually display three waveforms, pressure, flow, and volume.\nThe mode of ventilation describes the relationship between breath types, and cycle variables. The ventilator can either control the volume of air delivered or the pressure applied to the airway.\nFor each one of these modes, try to answer the following questions: What type of breath is delivered to the patient? which waveform changes based on the venilator settings? and which waveform is fixed?\n\r"

Her dyspnea worsened, and she failed to respond to non-invasive therapy. She was ultimately intbuated.\nThe initial ventilation settings were:  mode AC/VC, tidal volume 500 ml, respiratory rate 22 per min, PEEP 5 mmHg, Flow 60 L per min. \nYou were called to her bedside as she has been getting progressivly more hypotensive over the past 30 minutes.\nTake a look at the vent monitor below, and make appropriate changes to the vent. You can use the Pause Flow button below to pause the flow, and assess alveolar pressure.\nAs you change the settings watch the total PEEP, and retained volume change. The goal is to decrease the two numbers as much as possible.\nOPTION 1 - Adjust the Tidal Volume Increase TV to 800 ml Decrease TV to 300 ml Decrease TV to 100 ml\nOPTION 2 - Adjust the Respiratory Rate Increase RR to 30 breath per min Decrease RR to 15 breath per min Decrease RR to 10 breath per min\nOPTION 3 - Change the Amount of Flow Decrease the flow to 30 L/min Keep the flow at 60 L/min Increase the flow to 90 L/min\n  Pause | Resume Clear X+ X- Y+ Y- Palv Pmus Insp Pause Exp Pause Pertinent Metrics: Peak Pressure: {{Math.round(maxPaw)}} cmH2O, Plateau Pressure: {{Math.round(maxPalv)}} cmH2O, Total PEEP: {{Math.round(minPalv)}} cmH2O, Retained Volume: {{Math.round(minVolume * 1000)}} mL.  \n  Vent.RR = 25; Lung.Resistance = 30; window.onload = function () { Controls.xplus(); Controls.xplus(); Controls.xplus(); Controls.yminus(); Controls.yminus(); }  "
